Detecting symmetry in scalar fields is a nascent area of research and existing methods that detect symmetry are either not robust in the presence of noise or computationally costly. We propose a data structure called the augmented extremum graph and use it to design a novel symmetry detection method based on robust estimation of distances. The augmented extremum graph captures both topological and geometric information of the scalar field and enables robust and computationally efficient detection of symmetry. We apply the proposed method to detect symmetries in cryo-electron microscopy datasets and the experiments demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of detecting symmetry even in the presence of significant noise. We describe novel applications that use the detected symmetry to enhance visualization of scalar field data and facilitate their exploration.,Thomas,,,,

We replace a tedious manual process that is often based on guess-work and luck by a principled approach that systematically explores the parameter space. Our core idea is the following two-stage technique: We start with a sparse sampling of the parameter space and apply a statistical model to estimate the response of the segmentation algorithm. The statistical model incorporates a model of uncertainty of the estimation which we use in conjunction with the actual estimate in (visually) guiding the user towards areas that need refinement by placing additional sample points. In the second stage the user navigates through the parameter space in order to determine areas where the response value (goodness of segmentation) is high. In our exploration we rely on existing ground-truth images in order to evaluate the ""goodness"" of an image segmentation technique. We evaluate its usefulness by demonstrating this technique on two image segmentation algorithms: a three parameter model to detect microtubules in electron tomograms and an eight parameter model to identify functional regions in dynamic Positron Emission Tomography scans.",Torsney-Weir,,,,

Our model preserves material boundaries as well as fine tubular structures while noise is smoothed out. One of the major novelties is the use of the directional second derivative to define material boundaries instead of the gradient magnitude for thresholding. This results in a diffusion model that has much lower sensitivity to the diffusion parameter and smoothes material boundaries consistently compared to gradient magnitude based techniques. We empirically analyze the stability and convergence of the proposed diffusion and demonstrate its de-noising capabilities for both analytic and real data. We also discuss applications in the context of volume rendering.,Hosssain,,,,

Nested tetrahedral meshes generated through the longest edge bisection rule are commonly used to decompose regular volumetric datasets since they produce highly adaptive crack-free representations. Efficient representations for such models have been achieved by clustering the set of tetrahedra sharing a common longest edge into a structure called a diamond. The alignment and orientation of the longest edge can be used to implicitly determine the geometry of a diamond and its relations to the other diamonds within the hierarchy. We introduce the supercube as a high-level primitive within such meshes that encompasses all unique types of diamonds. A supercube is a coherent set of edges corresponding to three consecutive levels of subdivision. Diamonds are uniquely characterized by the longest edge of the tetrahedra forming them and are clustered in supercubes through the association of the longest edge of a diamond with a unique edge in a supercube. Supercubes are thus a compact and highly efficient means of associating information with a subset of the vertices,,,,,

We use a constrained Potts model to interpolate an arbitrary number of region boundaries between segmented images. This produces a segmented volume from which we extract a triangulated boundary surface using well-known marching tetrahedra methods. This surface contains staircase-like artifacts and an abundance of unnecessary triangles. We describe an approach that addresses these problems with a voxel-accurate simplification algorithm that reduces surface complexity by an order of magnitude. Our boundary interpolation and simplification methods are novel contributions to the study of surface extraction from segmented cross-sections.

Many diseases can be identified by abnormalities in the thicknesses of various retinal layers captured using optical coherence tomography (OCT). We used a support vector machine (SVM) to perform semi-automatic segmentation of retinal layers for subsequent analysis including a comparison of layer thicknesses to known healthy parameters. We have extended and generalized an older SVM approach to support better performance in a clinical setting through performance enhancements and graceful handling of inherent noise in OCT data by considering statistical characteristics at multiple levels of resolution. The addition of the multi-resolution hierarchy extends the SVM to have ""global awareness"". A feature",,,,,

An implementation of this fiber model on the graphics processing unit (GPU) is presented. Since the fiber paths can be stochastically generated independently of one another,,,,,

The application scenario is metrology and dimensional measurement in industrial high resolution 3D X-ray computed tomography (3DCT). Based on the dual source / dual exposure technology this method employs 3DCT scans of a high precision micro-focus and a high energy macro-focus X-ray source. The presented work makes use of the advantages of dual X-ray exposure technology in order to facilitate dimensional measurements of multi-material components with high density material within low density material. We propose a workflow which uses image fusion and local surface extraction techniques: a prefiltering step reduces noise inherent in the data. For image fusion the datasets have to be registered. In the fusion step the benefits of both scans are combined. The structure of the specimen is taken from the low precision,,,,,

In this contest participants were to use visual analytic tools to explore a large heterogeneous data collection to construct a scenario and find evidence buried in the data of illegal and terrorist activities that were occurring. A synthetic data set was made available as well as tasks. In this paper we describe some of the advances we have made from the first competition held in 2006.,Grinstein,,,,

We decompose the spectral description of h(x) into a scalar product of the spectral description of g(x) and a term that solely depends on f(x) and that is independent of g(x). We then use the method of stationary phase to derive the essential maximum frequency of g(f(x)) bounding the main portion of the energy of its spectrum. This limit is the product of the maximum frequency of g(x) and the maximum derivative of f(x). This leads to a proper sampling of the composition h of the two functions g and f. We apply our theoretical results to a fundamental open problem in volume rendering - the proper sampling of the rendering integral after the application of a transfer function. In particular,,,,,

Recent advances in graphics hardware allow for the ray traversal and volume sampling to be executed on a per-fragment level completely on the GPU leading to interactive framerates. In this work we present optimization techniques that improve the performance and quality of GPU-based volume raycasting. We apply a hybrid image/object space approach to accelerate the ray traversal in animation sequences that works for both isosurface rendering and semi-transparent volume rendering. An empty-space-leaping technique that exploits the spatial coherence between consecutively rendered images is used to estimate the optimal initial ray sampling point for each image pixel. These can double the rendering performance for typical volumetric data sets without sacrificing image quality. The achieved speed-up allows for further improvements of image quality. We demonstrate an object space antialiasing technique based on selective super-sampling at sharp creases and silhouette edges which also benefits from exploiting frame-to-frame coherence.,Klein,,,,

The motion is estimated through an eigenvector analysis of the spatio-temporal structure tensor at every pixel location. This approach is computationally demanding but allows reliable velocity estimates as well as quality indicators for the obtained results. We use a 2D color map and a region of interest selector for the visualization of the velocities. On the selected velocities we apply a hierarchical smoothing scheme which allows the choice of the desired scale of the motion field. We demonstrate several examples of test sequences in which some persons are moving with different velocities than others. These persons are visually marked in the real-time display of the image sequence. The tool is also applied to angiography sequences to emphasize the blood flow and its distribution. An efficient processing of the data streams is achieved by mapping the operations onto the stream architecture of standard graphics cards. The card receives the images and performs both the motion estimation and visualization,,,,,

Our method uses a volumetric fire propagation model based on an enhanced distance field. It can simulate the spreading of multiple fire fronts over a specified isosurface without actually having to create that isosurface. The distance field is generated from a specific shell volume that rapidly creates narrow spatial bands around the virtual surface of any given isovalue. The complete distance field is then obtained by propagation from the initial bands. At each step multiple fire fronts can evolve simultaneously on the volumetric object. The flames of the fire are constructed from streams of particles whose movement is regulated by a velocity field generated with the hardware-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM). The LBM provides a physically-based simulation of the air flow around the burning object. The object voxels and the splats associated with the flame particles are rendered in the same pipeline so that the volume data with its external and internal structures can be displayed along with the fire.,Ye Zhao;Wei,,,,

Existing algorithms typically rely on a single camera view and degrade in accuracy as the display resolution exceeds the camera resolution by several orders of magnitude. Naive approaches to integrating multiple zoomed camera views fail since small errors in aligning adjacent views propagate quickly over the display surface to create glaring discontinuities.

This interactive process can be very complicated and time consuming. An alternative to the adjustment of transfer functions is the application of segmentation algorithms.

We describe a new method that determines the membership of a given sample point to an object by reclassifying the sample point using interpolation of the original intensity values and searching for the best fitting object in the neighbourhood. Using a ray-casting approach we then compute the surface location between successive sample points along the viewing-ray by interpolation or bisection. The accurate calculation of the object boundary enables a much more precise computation of the gray-level-gradient yielding the surface normal. Our new approach significantly improves the quality of reconstructed and shaded surfaces and reduces aliasing artifacts for animations and magnified views.

The common trial-and-error approach for transfer function searching is a very difficult and time consuming process. A goal oriented and parameterized transfer function model is therefore crucial in guiding the transfer function searching process for better and more meaningful visualization results.

G. Turk and D. Banks (1996) developed an elegant technique for automatically placing seed points to achieve a uniform distribution of streamlines on a 2D vector field. Their method uses an energy function calculated from the low-pass filtered streamline image to guide the optimization process of the streamline distribution. This paper proposes a new technique for creating evenly distributed streamlines on 3D parametric surfaces found in curvilinear grids. We make use of Turk and Banks's 2D algorithm by first mapping the vectors on a 3D surface into the computational space of the curvilinear grid.

We survey the possible methods for normal estimation in volume rendering and divide them into two classes based on the delivered numerical accuracy. The three members of the first class determine the normal in two steps by employing both interpolation and derivative filters. Among these is a new method which has never been realized. The members of the first class are all equally accurate. The second class has only one member and employs a continuous derivative filter obtained through the analytic derivation of an interpolation filter. We use the new method to analytically compare the accuracy of the first class with that of the second. As a result of our analysis we show that even inexpensive schemes can in fact be more accurate than high order methods. We describe the theoretical computational cost of applying the schemes in a volume rendering application and provide guidelines for helping one choose a scheme for estimating derivatives. In particular we find that the new method can be very inexpensive and can compete with the normal estimations which pre-shade and pre-classify the volume (M. Levoy,,,,,

The rendering complexity is reduced to the geometry of the current cell thus increasing interactive performance. A portal is a generalization of windows and doors. It connects two adjacent cells (or rooms). Each portal of the current cell that is some distance away from the viewpoint is rendered as a texture. The portal texture (smoothly) returns to geometry when the viewpoint gets close to the portal. This way all portal sequences (not too close to the viewpoint) have a depth complexity of one. The size of each texture and distance at which the transition occurs is configurable for each portal.,Aliaga,,,,

Such data lends itself to simple 2D representations. The data described in this paper was gathered by a sail plane spiraling in an updraft within a thundercloud. The more complex organization of data samples demands more complex representation methods. This paper describes a system developed using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) to explore such data. The data consists of several scalar values and a set of vector values associated with positional data on the measuring devices. The goal of this visualization is to explore the location of point charges suggested by the electromagnetic field vectors and determine if any correlation exists between the point charge location and standard cloud microstructure scalar measurements such as temperature. There are several problems associated with visualizing this rather unique set of data. They stem from the fact that the data is a sparse spiraling sample of scalars and vectors. The system allows the track of the plane to be displayed as a line,,,,,

It also generates an excessively large number of triangles to represent an isosurface; this increases the rendering time. This paper presents a decimation method to reduce the number of triangles generated. Decimation is carried out before creating a large number of triangles. Four major steps comprise the algorithm: surface tracking,,,,,

The speed at which such triangulated surfaces can be displayed is crucial to interactive visualization and is bounded by the rate at which triangulated data can be sent to the graphics subsystem for rendering. Partitioning polygonal models into triangle strips can significantly reduce rendering times over transmitting each triangle individually.

Computational fluid dynamics data is in principle well suited for DVR. But efficient mappings of the directional information of vector fields are still to be found. We investigate how the raycasting technique can be used to directly render vector fields. Our approach is based on the perception that other flow visualization techniques use visualization objects that are locally tangential to the vector field together with directed light sources. From this,,,,,

An algorithm is presented that allows very rapid representation of an interval set surrounding an iso contour surface. The algorithm draws upon three main ideas. A fast indexing scheme is used to select only those data points near the contour surface. Hardware assisted splatting is then employed on these data points to produce a volume rendering of the interval set. Finally,,,,,

This presents some challenging problems in the visualization of environmental data. This data often consists of unevenly distributed samples. Typically a two-step approach is used to visualize environmental data. First the unevenly distributed sample data are modeled onto a uniform 3-D grid. This grid model is subsequently rendered using conventional grid-based visualization techniques. This paper discusses some of the limitations of this approach and highlights areas where further research is needed to improve the accuracy of visualization for environmental applications.,Yingcai Xiao;Ziebarth,,,,

It is based on transforming the vector field from a traditionally Eulerian reference frame into a Lagrangian reference frame. Fluid elements are traced through the vector field for the mean path as well as the statistical dispersion of the fluid elements about the mean position by using added scalar information about the root mean square value of the vector field and its Lagrangian time scale.

The focus is on interactively sensing and exploring real and symmetric second-order tensor data by generalizing the vector notion of streamline to the tensor concept of hyperstreamline.

The authors present an algorithm that produces a hierarchy of triangulations in which each level of the hierarchy corresponds to a guaranteed level of accuracy. The number of very thin triangles (slivers) is significantly reduced. Such triangles produced undesirable effects in animation. In addition the number of levels of the triangulated irregular network (TIN) tree is reduced. This speeds up searching within the data structure. Tests on data with digital elevation input have confirmed the theoretical expectations. On eight such sets the average sliveriness with the method was between 1/5 and 1/10 of old triangulations and number of levels was about one third. There was an increase in the number of descendants at each level,,,,,

The definition of free-form volumes generalizes techniques from free-form curves and surfaces to trivariate representation. The definition is given for volumes in the Bernstein-Bezier representation. The author illustrates an intersection algorithm that can be used to perform intersection operations on free-form volumes. Some calculated examples are given. The algorithm can be used as a subroutine for algorithms which are able to perform more general intersections of free-form volumes,,,,,

It has been found that excellent reconstructions can be made from serial sections acquired using a charge-coupled device and a conventional light microscope. Both confocal and nonconfocal reconstructions are examined. The effects of differing light sources are considered 3D image processing results are presented,Senft,,,,
